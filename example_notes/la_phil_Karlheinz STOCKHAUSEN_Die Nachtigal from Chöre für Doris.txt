Karlheinz STOCKHAUSEN: Die Nachtigal from Chöre für Doris
German composer and theorist Karlheinz Stockhausen, born in Mödrath, has been a pioneer in electronic music, as well as an innovator in new uses of physical space in music and improvisational forms. He studied with Frank Martin at the Cologne Hochschule für Musik, but it wasn't until he became acquainted with the music of Messiaen (with whom he later studied) that he began to develop his own musical personality.
Stockhausen considered his first "real" work to be Kontre-Punkte (1952-3), and gave it the catalog number "1"; he assigned fractions to all works prior to that. Chöre für Doris, his earliest catalogued piece, numbered "1/11", is a set of three songs for chorus. Composed in 1950 during his study with Martin, the set bears no resemblance to works he was to compose even one year later (after his discovery of Messiaen's music), and it was not performed until 1971 (incidentally, by the same chorus that premiered Cinq rechants). The texts are German translations of French poetry by Paul Verlaine.
