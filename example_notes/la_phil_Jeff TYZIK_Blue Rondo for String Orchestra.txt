Jeff TYZIK: Blue Rondo for String Orchestra
In addition to his active schedule as an arranger and conductor of music of all sorts, this evening's guest conductor is also a composer. This work is the final movement of Jeff Tyzik's (b. 1952) Blues Suite for String Quintet, which also includes movements entitled Blue Funk and Blue Adagio.
